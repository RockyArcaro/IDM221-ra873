    <div class="aboutmecontainer">
        <p class="aboutmetext">My name is Rocky Arcaro, I am a second year UX Major at Drexel University. I am a part of proactive student organizations such as The Good Idea Fund and Sigma Phi Epsilon. I primarily do any art/marketing tasks needed, but also take on different roles such as event planning, and new member coordinator.</p>
        <p class="aboutmetext">While growing up in Plymouth Meeting PA, I had a creative mindset and an unquenchable thirst for anything design. Surrounding myself in creative hobbies such as digital art, painting xbox controllers, and other arts paved the way for me to become the UX student I am now.</p>
